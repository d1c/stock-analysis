# Stock Analysis using Excel & VBA

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to use stock market data to learn Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) with Excel. We will use VBA to analyze and make calculations for several companies stock market performance. The criteria was simply to measure each company's total volume and return for the years being analyzed.The completed analysis can then be used by the end user to determine if one company would be a better investment than the others. 

The VBA script that runs the analysis was written with the existing data in mind from just two years of information for 12 companies. The VBA script appeared to run efficiently. However, with the concern that it could be used on a much larger dataset we refactored the code to make it run faster and more efficiently.

## Results of Analysis

## Summary
Summary statement that addresses two questions
1. What are the advantages & disadvantages of refactoring code.
2. How do these pros & cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script.
